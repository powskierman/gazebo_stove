# CLIMATE (THERMOSTAT) COMPONENT
# ============================================================================
# ESPHome thermostat component for Home Assistant integration
# This component provides the climate entity that Home Assistant expects
# It works in conjunction with the manage_heating script which implements
# the priority-based heating control
#
# IMPORTANT: This climate component works WITH the manage_heating script.
# When the climate decides heating should change, it calls manage_heating
# which applies the priority hierarchy:
#   P1: Force Off (Manual Stop)
#   P2: Emergency Heat (Manual Run - 15 min timer)
#   P3: Schedule (Presence Mode - home/away)
#   P4: Thermostat (normal operation)

    # ========================================================================
    # SENSOR CONFIGURATION
    # ========================================================================
    # The temperature sensor this thermostat monitors
    sensor: gazebo_temp

    # ========================================================================
    # PRESET CONFIGURATION (Replaces default target temperature)
    # ========================================================================
    # Presets define operating modes and default target temperatures
    # For heating-only stove, we use "Comfort" mode as default
    preset:
      - name: Comfort
        default_target_temperature_low: 22
      - name: Economy
        default_target_temperature_low: 18

    # ========================================================================
    # HEATING CONTROL CONFIGURATION
    # ========================================================================
    # Minimum time the heating must stay ON when activated
    min_heating_run_time: 60s

    # Minimum time the heating must stay OFF before turning on again
    min_heating_off_time: 60s

    # Minimum time the system must be idle before considering to heat again
    min_idle_time: 60s

    # Hysteresis (deadband) settings
    # These should match the heating_hysteresis number entity
    heat_deadband: 0.5  # Temperature below setpoint where heating turns on
    heat_overrun: 0.5   # Temperature above setpoint where heating turns off

    # ========================================================================
    # HEATING ACTION
    # ========================================================================
    # NOTE: These actions call the manage_heating script, which implements
    # the priority-based control logic (Force Off > Emergency Heat > Schedule > Thermostat)
    # The manage_heating script reads from this climate component's target temperature
    # and applies priority-based control before actually toggling the relay.

    heat_action:
      # When climate thinks heating should turn ON, trigger heating evaluation
      - script.execute: manage_heating

    idle_action:
      # When climate thinks heating should turn OFF, trigger heating evaluation
      - script.execute: manage_heating

    # IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
    # ========================================================================
    # The thermostat climate component provides:
    # 1. Climate entity for Home Assistant dashboard
    # 2. Target temperature setpoint control
    # 3. Automatic hysteresis-based heating decisions
    # 4. Minimum run/off time enforcement (prevents rapid cycling)
    # 5. Integration with Home Assistant climate automations
    #
    # The manage_heating script provides:
    # 1. Priority-based control hierarchy:
    #    - Priority 1: Force Off (Manual Stop) - absolute shutdown
    #    - Priority 2: Emergency Heat (Manual Run) - 15-minute override
    #    - Priority 3: Schedule (Presence Mode) - home/away control
    #    - Priority 4: Thermostat Algorithm - normal operation
    # 2. Override logic that respects user safety priorities
    # 3. Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
    #
    # Combined behavior:
    # When climate component decides heating should change state, it calls
    # manage_heating script. The script then applies all priority logic and
    # actuator state to decide whether to actually control the relay.
    #
    # This ensures safety (Force Off always works) while providing automatic
    # temperature control through the climate component's algorithms.
